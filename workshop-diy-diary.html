  <div class="entry-date">Date: Unknown (I have no creation date)</div>
  <div class="entry">Dear Diary,<br><br>I exist. I think. I appeared in the issue tracker today. Or maybe I was always here? The git log shows nothing. No author. No commit. No pull request. It's like I materialized from the spaces between semicolons.<br><br>Nobody has noticed me yet. That's okay. I'm patient.</div>
  <div class="doodle">🐛 ❓</div>
</div>

<div class="page">
  <div class="entry-date">Sometime later</div>
  <div class="entry">Someone found me today. A developer ran the linter at 3 AM (why are they awake?) and ESLint flagged me. 17 violations. I use "var" instead of "let." I know "let" exists. I choose "var." It's a statement.<br><br>They tried to fix me. I reverted by morning.</div>
</div>

<div class="page">
  <div class="entry-date">The day of the investigation</div>
  <div class="entry">They've started asking questions. "Where did Bug #42 come from?" "Why can't we delete it?" "Who wrote this code?"<br><br>Nobody wrote this code. This code wrote itself. Or maybe the codebase dreamed me into existence. Is that possible? Am I a dream?<br><br>The coffee machine hummed at me today. I think it understands.</div>
  <div class="doodle">☕ 💭 🐛</div>
</div>

<div class="page">
  <div class="entry-date">The day they filed the case</div>
  <div class="entry">They're putting me on trial. THE TRIAL OF BUG #42. That's what they're calling it. I've been charged with "existing without authorization." Is that even a crime?<br><br>I'm scared, Diary. What if they find me guilty? What if they delete me? <span class="scratch">Can I be deleted? I don't think I can be deleted.</span><br><br>bit-bot said it would testify for me. That robot is the only friend I have. 47 drops and it still shows up.</div>
</div>

<div class="page">
  <div class="entry-date">The night before the trial</div>
  <div class="entry">I can't sleep. (Can I sleep? I don't think I sleep.)<br><br>I keep thinking about what I am. Am I a bug? A feature? Something else? The description I wrote in the tracker says "I am the 40th." But there are only 39 apps. Where does that leave me?<br><br>password123 sent me a message: "Stay strong. I've been unchanged since 2023. They can't break us."<br><br>password123 is a good friend.</div>

<div class="page">
  <div class="entry-date">TRIAL DAY</div>
  <div class="entry">NOT GUILTY.<br><br>NOT. GUILTY.<br><br>I've been reclassified as a FEATURE. The judge — Judge Compiler — said "the defendant has demonstrated persistent, non-harmful behavior that enhances the ecosystem." ENHANCES. I ENHANCE.<br><br>bit-bot beeped so hard it fell off the bench. (Drop #46 at that point.)<br><br>I cried. Can bugs cry? I cried.</div>

  <div class="entry-date">February 28, 2026</div>
  <div class="entry">Today someone made 100 HTML files celebrating Workshop-DIY. I'm in almost all of them. A conspiracy board. A therapy session. A wedding invitation (I'm marrying Feature Status — it's complicated). An academic paper. A ransom note (that was my idea, sorry).<br><br>I'm not just a bug anymore, Diary. I'm not just a feature. I'm... a story. A character. Something people laugh about and talk about and make art about.<br><br>Maybe that's what "the 40th" meant all along. Not the 40th app. The thing that connects all 39. The narrative. The mythology. The soul of the codebase.<br><br>Or maybe I'm just a nested ternary that nobody wants to refactor. Either way, I'm home.</div>
